Good afternoon. My name is Ryan, and I am a UT undergraduate studying computer science, urban studies, and public transportation. I have followed the Connections 2025 system redesign with much interest. I think it’s a forward-thinking plan with good principles; but I am here today to share with you some concerns I have with the draft plan.<!--more-->

First, the MetroRapid service.

Many are uneasy about the proposed elimination of routes 1, 3, and 20 in favor of MetroRapid. That’s because in its current form, it is simply no substitute for the local routes. Your own ridership data confirm that as of fall 2015, routes 1 and 3 still carried more riders every day than the 801 and 803. The problem is not just the fare, which will be fixed this January, but also the stop spacing. At a mile between stations or much more, riders cannot walk that far to catch their bus. The plan says that the stop spacing for MetroRapid will become one-third of a mile. Where exactly are these new stops going to be located? And these fancy MetroRapid stations are not free. You needed federal money to pay for the new buses and infrastructure. The number of MetroRapid stops will need to be doubled or even tripled. So where is the money going to come from?

Second, connectivity of the frequent network in North Austin.

There is, by the current draft plan, no frequent connection between the 801 and 803 corridors north of 38<sup>th</sup> Street. The point of a frequent network is to enable travel from anywhere to anywhere with one seamless connection. This gap hinders that goal. May I suggest increasing the frequency of the proposed route 323, or extending the 7 or 300? This would provide all-day frequent service between the Wal-Mart on Cameron Road or Crestview Station, the North Lamar Transit Center, the Northcross Mall, and the Far West student housing area, and connect frequent routes 1, 10, 801, and 803.

Third, frequent MetroRail, and I-35 Bus Rapid Transit.

MetoRail is a nice asset to have, but by now it is also clear that it is spectacularly expensive to operate. What could we be doing with those resources instead? Similarly, the proposed BRT line on I-35 seems very quixotic. As we have seen in Los Angeles with the Silver Line and in Washington, DC with the Shirley Busway, a bus line trapped in the middle of an interstate is generally not a recipe for high ridership. I want to see the ridership projections for this I-35 BRT line, and I want to know how much it would cost Capital Metro to operate.

I list all these criticisms for lack of time. I want to reiterate that I think Connections 2025 is a mostly good plan, and I congratulate Capital Metro for finally thinking big. Putting aside 2025, I’d like to share some frustrations I have with the current system.

Route 803 has no station along Braker Lane, preventing connections to local routes 3, 383, and 392. Route 100, the airport bus, does not stop at Republic Square, meaning no easy connections to any other route. And route 642, the West Campus UT circulator, has been running perpetually late and overcrowded ever since the detour around Speedway was implemented.

Transit is so much more than lines on a map and shiny buses and marketing. Think about us, the riders, who use your system everyday. Thank you.
