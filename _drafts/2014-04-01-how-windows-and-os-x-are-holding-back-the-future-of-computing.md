Where is the tech industry heading? What is The Next Big Thing (TM) in computers and devices? More awesome power? Higher clock speeds? Faster processors and graphics cards?

Well, not really. Computers are still getting faster year after year, but the rate is starting to slow down. Instead, the true revolution that computers are undergoing is that they are getting _greener_.

The rise of the smartphone and tablet has meant that a super-fast CPU can no longer just be fast. It also has to consume less power and hence be more efficient. So, greener!

We&#8217;re to the point where you can take any crappy machine and most people will be just fine with it. After all, they only want to check Facebook, use MS Office, and perhaps play the occasional game. A simple Core i3/HD Graphics/2 GB RAM build is perfect for the majority of computer users. But even the cheapest machine will still run a few hundred dollars retail. And it consumes lots of energy and has noisy, dust-sucking fans.

For the past decade, Intel processors have had a near-monopoly on the PC market. What about AMD? Well, their processors have the same architecture as the Intel chipsets so that they can run the same software. (Otherwise, nobody would buy them!) People referred to this as the &#8220;Wintel&#8221; complex, because the de-facto standard for computers became a Windows PC with an Intel x86 processor. And then Apple surrendered and put Intel processors in their Macs as well.

Intel, it&#8217;s been fun, but x86 isn&#8217;t one-size-fits-all. And that&#8217;s where ARM processors come in.

ARM powers everything mobile, from the iPhone to the Galaxy Note to the Nexus 7. Recent-generation chips offer very respectable performance without compromising on power consumption or thermal waste. Your ARM tablet is fanless and gets at least 10 hours of battery life. How exactly does your Intel laptop stack up?

So why isn&#8217;t everything with a battery in it using an ARM processor? Because Windows and Mac OS X wouldn&#8217;t run on it. Microsoft actually made a somewhat serious attempt at a ARM version of Windows with Windows RT, which powers the Surface (and its successor) and other Windows 8 tablets.

But it sucked. It was marketed as &#8220;full Windows,&#8221; but in reality you couldn&#8217;t install any software from outside the Microsoft Store nor install alternative operating systems because the bootloader was locked down. Microsoft was treating the whole endeavor as a &#8220;Pro&#8221; version of Windows Phone, not as a port of desktop Windows to ARM processors.

Another problem is lack of support from commercial software vendors. Because the source code is not available for proprietary programs, you can&#8217;t just recompile them yourself for ARM machines like you can with open-source programs.

Low-cost ARM machines like the [ODROID U2][1] (which powers my website, by the way) are the greener future of computing. Early adopters like myself are already purchasing these devices to run full-size Linux on.

Imagine $100 &#8211; $200 computers available to charities and the poor with no compromises in features and performance.

Imagine the power savings our own school could reap if we overhauled the behemoth that is our library computer system. (Windows XP is about to die, by the way &#8211; I will elaborate on that in a future post.)

Imagine your giant desktop tower replaced with a tiny cube that doesn&#8217;t need fans and consumes no more power under full load than a charging smartphone.

Your move, Microsoft and Apple.
