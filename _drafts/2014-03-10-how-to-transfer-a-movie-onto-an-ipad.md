So a friend of mine caught me outside the library today. She had a flash drive with her Theology video project on it, and wondered if I had a USB cable to connect it to her iPad.

What she was asking for was a [USB On-The-Go cable][1], and it only works with certain Android smartphones. USB OTG will never, ever be implemented on any Apple device.

&#8230;Back to the story. I had actually run into this situation before. I had a video project back in first semester Theology that I had to get onto my iPad. (The teacher expected us to present them using AirPlay &#8211; due to the incredible packet loss on our wireless network, however, AirPlay was totally unusable. I ended up plugging the classroom projector into my laptop.)

I did it by starting a HTTP server (darkhttpd, if you must know) on one of my Linux machines and using a free video downloader app on the iPad to download the video file over the network and save it to the camera roll. Quite a workaround, but it worked! (Note: Our school prohibits us from syncing with iTunes, and furthermore iTunes is absolutely horrible software that nobody ever wants to use.)

Remembering what I had done a few months back, I plugged her flash drive into my laptop and fired up darkhttpd. Then I instructed her to download the app I had used. Once it installed, we opened it up, pointed it to the laptop&#8217;s IP address, and bam! The movie had been downloaded.

She was very impressed. ðŸ™‚

Still, this reminded me yet again of how frustrating it is to use an iPad. None of this really would have been necessary if the iPad had USB OTG, like most tablets these days, or had Bluetooth file transfers.

That&#8217;s why, this semester, I ditched mine once and for all and started using my laptop in class.
