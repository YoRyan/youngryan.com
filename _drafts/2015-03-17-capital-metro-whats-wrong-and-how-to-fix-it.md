Having lived in Austin for some months now I&#8217;ve been surprised by the lack of quality public transportation in a so-called “liberal” and “weird” city.

Austinites like [Mike Dahmus][1] criticize Capital Metro constantly for being inefficient, opaque, and making all the wrong decisions.

After many sleepless nights thinking about Capital Metro&#8217;s shortcomings, I thought I&#8217;d add my viewpoint to the Austin transit scene.

  * **Poorly laid out routes.** Just look at the [Capital Metro system map][2] (warning: ridiculously large PDF) and see how Austin&#8217;s transit lines are structured. It&#8217;s clear that they are designed to do one thing: provide single-seat rides from the suburbs to the downtown core. But this is the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and as modern transit planners have noted, downtown just isn&#8217;t that important anymore. What happens if you want to go somewhere else besides downtown? On Capital Metro, be prepared for numerous transfers, long waits, and very, very long travel times.
  * **Too focused on coverage.** So many of Capital Metro&#8217;s routes [zigzag through neighborhoods][3] and detour into strip malls to provide “service” to those special-interest areas. Also, particularly in the downtown/UT core, there are far too many stops. This is the safe way to run transit if you&#8217;re looking to appease your political base, but the fact is that streamlining routes and consolidating stops would go a long way in speeding up service. This would result in a more efficient system, increased frequencies, and lower operating costs.
  * **Not enough frequency or weekend service.** Routes have 30-minute headways if you&#8217;re lucky. On weekends, particularly Sundays, be prepared to wait 45 to 60 minutes for the next bus. Also, there are no express buses running on the weekend.
  * **Too confusing.** Bus stops signs are nearly impossible to decipher, and in a lot of cases the information is incomplete (e.g. no indication that certain stops are drop-off only). The headways are not only long, they&#8217;re also inconsistent (varying between 25-35 minutes), forcing you to check the schedule to _really_ know when the bus will arrive. I have also seen riders get on the wrong route or attempt to pay for an express bus with a local day pass. Maybe Capital Metro should stop flashing random messages like “ATX IS HANDS FREE” on the destination blinds.
  * **Commuter-oriented.** Far too many of Capital Metro&#8217;s services are only useful to commuters. I&#8217;m talking about [buses that only run one direction in the morning and the other direction in the evening][4]. Or [coach-style buses to nowhere with no obvious connections to local service][5]. Good transit isn&#8217;t about getting you to work and back – it&#8217;s about being there for all your transportation needs, anytime, anywhere.
  * **Trains to nowhere.** Austin&#8217;s over-hyped MetroRail service connects North Austin&#8217;s far-flung suburbs with downtown. Well, in theory. The downtown station is half-mile walk from the local bus routes, so walking that distance to make a transfer is a pain. (Furthermore, forget about making a transfer to Amtrak or [Lone Star Rail][6] if it ever gets built.) And MetroRail completely misses the UT campus, making it useless for students. Capital Metro&#8217;s [latest rail expansion plan][7] (November 2014) called for light rail tracks in a very low-ridership corridor. It reeked of developer speculation and special-interest lobbying; Austinites were smart to turn it down.
  * **Poor downtown coverage.** So you ride the bus downtown. Great, the mediocre bus system is working to your advantage. But where do you go from here? Capital Metro recently realigned _all_ services onto the same pair of streets, so many downtown attractions are a half-mile walk or more from the nearest bus stop. Oh, and the downtown circulator named the “Dillo” was cut a few years ago.

“Crap Metro” should follow the lead of other cities like Houston, which is [transforming][8] its bus system into an efficient grid network and built a cost-effective, high-ridership light rail system. (Oh, the irony! A conservative Texas city with progressive transit policies!)

Instead, it&#8217;s poured all its resources into more commuter-centric services and a “Bus Rapid Transit” project that isn&#8217;t actually BRT _and_ has a premium fare.

I am shocked that Austinites aren&#8217;t demanding better.
