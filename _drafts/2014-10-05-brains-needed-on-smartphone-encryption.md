The other day, I was reading [a Washington Post article][1] that called for a &#8220;compromise&#8221; on &#8220;new&#8221; smartphone encryption technologies.

I&#8217;m sick and tired of ignorant (I will refrain from&#8230; saucier words) news publications and journalists who seem to think that technologies become &#8220;new&#8221; when Apple implements them into their products.

Notice the article&#8217;s opener: It talks about &#8220;next-generation encryption technology&#8221; on &#8220;Appleâ€™s new iPhone.&#8221; First of all, data encryption is nothing new. Programs and tools to protect data on your computers have been around for forever. I use them right now on my Linux laptop!

But what about smartphones, you might ask? Well, mobile phone encryption has been a _standard feature_ for years! _Right now_ I (and [80% of the rest of the world][2]) can encrypt my Android device and make it totally inaccessible to law enforcement. Unless they get me to cough up the passphrase, anyway.

These is just another example of Apple not having basic features on its crappy devices and then trying to pass off its catch-up game as wildly &#8220;cutting-edge&#8221; and &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; enhancements. Only someone grossly incompetent in the technology field (like a hipster Washington Post journalist) would fall for this kind of nonsensical hype.

That said, Google announced that Android L will encrypt user data by default right after Apple announced their encryption scheme. I think it&#8217;s likely that there was some collusion behind the timing of these decisions &#8211; after all, if it were only one tech company pushing for this kind of thing, there would be even more pressure mounted against that company.

Back to the article, the authors proposed creating a &#8220;golden key they [Apple and Google] would retain and use only __when a court has approved a search warrant.&#8221; The problem with this scheme is that _such a &#8220;golden key&#8221; is a security nightmare_. The devil is in the details. Who keeps ownership of this key? Who&#8217;s to say it won&#8217;t be leaked to Wikileaks or The Pirate Bay within a week of the rollouts of Android L and iOS 8?

Backdoors and secret keys hurt everyone, because backdoors do not discern. Just because only the good guys can get in does not mean that the bad guys won&#8217;t be able to do the same thing. As [Bruce Schneier said][3],

> We have one infrastructure. We can&#8217;t choose a world where the US gets to spy and the Chinese don&#8217;t. We get to choose a world where everyone can spy, or a world where no one can spy. We can be secure from everyone, or vulnerable to anyone. And I&#8217;m tired of us choosing surveillance over security.

I&#8217;m against encrypting smartphones by default only because there will always be _that one guy_ who forgets his passphrase and has to erase all of his now-inaccessible user data. But it&#8217;s still exciting to see encryption finally become mainstream.

Sorry surveillance state, but we won this fight decades ago. We have a right to keep our digital stuff private. Until you can invent a mind reading device or start extracting forced confessions, you&#8217;ll have to rely on old-fashioned detective work.
