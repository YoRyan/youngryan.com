Golden Empire Transit is going to hold a public hearing on some [proposed service changes][1].

A few thoughts:

  * 21/22/44 are due to see more buses (which means slight frequency increases, I guess). Always a good thing! The 21/22 especially deserve 20-minute or better frequencies on the weekends.
  * 61 finally gets evening service! (As this is my go-to bus route this is advantageous for me personally ðŸ™‚ .) It sucked not having a ride after 6 PM. Still needs a frequency increase (which is actually on GET&#8217;s long-term plans). One can dream.
  * 62 will get evening service too.
  * 82 will now provide evening service to the Northwest Promenade, meaning better access to the businesses there and connections (albeit poorly-timed) to the 61.
  * Holiday service has been eliminated, but with those abysmal boarding numbers, I suppose it&#8217;s not hard to see why.

Since GET is just now proposing these changes, perhaps their ridership is finally starting to see an increase since the route reorganization and the summer 2014 strike.
