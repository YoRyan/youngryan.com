With school out for the summer, I found myself getting back into flight simulator development. My plan is to model the terminals of the Fresno and Bakersfield airports. I am targeting FlightGear Flight Simulator specifically, since I am familiar with the platform, but am also going to try and get the models on FSX.

Hopefully this is one project that I will be able to finish.

So, without further ado, here is the first update &#8211; what I&#8217;ve been working on for the past couple weeks. You can expect another one every other week or so. Enjoy!

I&#8217;ve started out with Meadows Field. This being my home airport, I&#8217;ve put a lot of effort into being accurate, especially since the small terminal means more attention is drawn to small details.

I&#8217;ve made substantial progress on the airside portion (and have refrained from announcing this project until then). I am using Blender&#8217;s material and rendering system to bake textures into the model. This is my first time doing something like this, but if all goes well, it should look almost this good in the low-poly sim model, too.

Here is [a panorama][1] of the actual terminal for comparison. (The irony &#8211; Delta Connection no longer flies here, though all air service is still operated exclusively by SkyWest CRJ200s.)
