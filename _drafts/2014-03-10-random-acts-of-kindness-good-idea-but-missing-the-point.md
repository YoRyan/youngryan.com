In school these days, you hear a lot about “random acts of kindness.” The current fad among teachers and administrators is to encourage kids to be nicer to each other through “random” actions.

Random acts of kindness is looking at the problem the wrong way, and here&#8217;s why.

It is based on the idea that we are a community because we do kind acts. In reality, it is the other way around. People do nice things for each other ___because_ they are part of a community. If kind acts are on short supply, that is because we lack the required sense of communal spirit.

So what about the Garces student body? Our sense of community is nonexistent.

I was on my way to school this morning when I passed by a neighbor working on his RV. Know what I did? I said hi to him. I can&#8217;t imagine how I looked, this crazy Garces kid with a huge backpack and a musical instrument in one hand; but he smiled back and I&#8217;m sure it made his day.

That&#8217;s action. That&#8217;s real. That&#8217;s community.

How many other Garces kids can say they do things like that? None of them. They fly to school in their air-conditioned, stereo-booming SUVs and pickup trucks. Their social life is their petty little cliques of friends seen together during breaks. And when they rush across town to get back to their gated neighborhoods? They spend their time on their smartphones, chatting with their so-called friends over Facebook or Snapchat or whichever social network the spotlight is currently on.

Even students that live within walking distance, like myself, never spend time with each other outside of school. No, they whisk themselves away to sporting events, orchestra practices, and the latest tablet games. And the moment they get their drivers&#8217; licenses, they are thrilled to ditch their serene five-minute walks to school for ten-second car rides.

It&#8217;s obvious to anyone that the “Garces community” is deeply dysfunctional. To expect these kids to take time to “smell the roses” is a fallacy. And no amount of random acts of kindness will fix it.
