Every once in awhile, I come across some dumb article [like this one][1] that proclaims how &#8220;amazing&#8221; and &#8220;intuitive&#8221; the latest version of Mac OS X is compared to Windows &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry, &#8220;PC&#8217;s.&#8221;

Maybe I&#8217;m just a [grumpy cat][2], but OS X never came across as &#8220;intuitive&#8221; to me at all. Here&#8217;s some reasons why:

### Beauty over function.

Apple put a lot of effort into making their flagship operating system &#8220;beautiful.&#8221; _A lot._ Obviously, beauty is very subjective, but I will say that Quartz (all those fancy effects) never impressed me. It just seemed like a lot of useless eye-candy. Worse still, it gets in your way. The &#8220;swoosh&#8221; effect when opening programs is disturbing. And all the fades make the system feel slower.

&#8220;But wait! Windows 7 introduced the same crap, and besides you can turn it off!&#8221;

Well yes, of course. But the problem is that &#8220;beauty over function&#8221; is persistent throughout all of Apple&#8217;s design language. One example of this is the ridiculous fan of Finder folders that pops out from the dock. Do you enjoy tilting your head and moving your eyes up 20 huge icons to find the folder you want? I sure as hell don&#8217;t.

### Unergonomic.

Apple just loves to tote how &#8220;user-friendly&#8221; their operatingÂ  system is, but a lot of it is just plain backwards.

Toolbars and window controls &#8211; why are they fixed to the top of the screen? Why are they not, I don&#8217;t know, _attached to the freakin&#8217; window I&#8217;m supposed to be controlling?_ I hate having to drag my cursor all the way to the top so I can access a dropdown menu.

Strange keyboard commands &#8211; Finder is the most egregious example. Why in the world would I press &#8220;Enter&#8221; to rename a file and &#8220;Space&#8221; to open a file? Surely it should be the other way around?!

The mouse &#8211; Apple mice come with one mouse button only (not counting the horrible scroll ball or all the &#8220;multitouch&#8221; s&#8211;t). That was cute back in 1990, when the most complex program you ever used was Paint, but this is 2014. Every program you use is going to demand some use of the now-absent right mouse button. Well, I can emulate a right mouse click with the Control key, so thanks for half a&#8211;ing it. I guess.

### Inefficient.

Apple software means Apple hardware, which means Apple keyboards. You know, those flat, &#8220;stylish&#8221; chiclets that feel absolutely horrible. Sorry, but I happen to type faster than 20 words per minute. I think I&#8217;ll stick with my mechanical keyboard.

Apple keyboards, especially the miniaturized ones, tend to lack certain tactile cues, like dimples on the &#8220;F&#8221; and &#8220;J&#8221; keys and island-separated function keys. This means glancing at the keys more often to figure out where your fingers are.

And speaking of function keys, they&#8217;ve started that stupid trend of making the media keys primary and the actual function keys shifted. (I happen to use the F keys probably five times more often than I use the media keys.)

But it&#8217;s all in the name of style.

And finally, I&#8217;m going to pick on the aspect of Mac OS X I hate the most. _The damned dock._

Full disclosure: I grew up on Windows and the taskbar. Know what I&#8217;ve realized? _The taskbar works_. It&#8217;s a fast and efficient way to switch to exactly the window you want. (Nowadays I use tiling window managers, so there is no need for such a thing.)

But with the dock, _there is no distinction between switching to a program and opening a new instance._ What I mean is that if you wanted to open a new Finder window from the dock, you can&#8217;t exactly do that: if you clicked its icon in the dock, it would switch to an already open window.

&#8220;But you can use Command-N!&#8221;

Sure, as long as the program implemented that correctly.

And finally, the dock itself is just an enormous waste of space. You lose like 10-15% of your vertical pixels. Sure, you can auto-hide it, but it&#8217;s even _more intrusive_ to have it pop up whenever you accidentally move the cursor to the bottom.

But most Apple users I see only open one thing at a time or _really_ like looking at their desktop background, so&#8230;
