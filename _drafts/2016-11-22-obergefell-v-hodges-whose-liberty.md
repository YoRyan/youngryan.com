In its sweeping ruling on _Obergefell v. Hodges_, the Supreme Court overturned all state laws prohibiting same-sex marriages. Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee had argued that allowing same-sex couples to marry would denigrate marriage as an institution expressly for the purpose of procreation. The majority of the Court responded that it was illogical to suggest that opposite-sex couples would choose not to marry merely because same-sex couples could, and that marriage between same-sex couples could not harm the partners or any other members of society. Thus, this was not a basis to prohibit the marriage of same-sex couples.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a>

In his dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts recognized the majority’s logic as an application of John Stuart Mill’s so-called “harm principle”: the idea that the only legitimate sphere of government is to prevent an individual from harming others. Roberts claims that the harm principle is nowhere to be found in the Constitution and therefore not a legitimate criterion for constitutionality. The right to enact a social doctrine like the harm principle belongs to Congress and the people, not the judges of the Supreme Court:

> But a Justice’s commission does not confer any special moral, philosophical, or social insight sufficient to justify imposing these perceptions on fellow citizens under the pretense of “due process.” There is indeed a process due the people on issues of this sort–the democratic process. Respecting that understanding requires the Court to be guided by law, not any particular school of social thought.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a>

Justice Roberts is right to rebuke the majority for overturning state marriage laws on the presumption of a constitutional principle that doesn’t exist. The majority opinion claims that the Constitution promises “a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a> But while the Constitution mentions “liberty” in several passages, it does not enshrine any specific form or interpretation of it; neither the harm principle nor any other notion of liberty is present. Rather, Americans are free to make laws and institutions based upon their perception of liberty, be it Mill’s harm principle or some other understanding of it. By conflating its concept of liberty with the harm principle, the majority overstepped its proper bounds.<!--more-->

John Stuart Mill laid out his conception of liberty and the harm principle in his treatise, _On Liberty_. Defining liberty as “protection against the tyranny of the political rulers,” Mill describes the proliferation of democracy throughout human history as one development in the “struggle between Liberty and Authority.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a> But according to Mill, this struggle did not end in popular sovereignty and self-government. “There is a limit to the legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual independence, and to find that limit, and maintain it against encroachment, is … indispensable to a good condition of human affairs.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a> This is the challenge that all societies face, whether ruled by king or ballot.

First, Mill posits that society has no right to suppress any opinions. Truth can only be discovered when ideas and discussions flow freely between its members. A man “whose judgment is really deserving of confidence” is only so because “he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and conduct.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>6</sup></a> And Mill refutes the argument that the persecution of an opinion is natural and inevitable, “an ordeal through which truth ought to pass, and always passes successfully,” noting that there were twenty iterations of the Reformation before it finally succeeded in Martin Luther.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc"><sup>7</sup></a> Second, Mill claims that society must allow not only the freedom to have opinions, but also to express them. It ought to celebrate individuality, not reject it. Human nature is “a living thing” and “a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides,”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc"><sup>8</sup></a> and in order for society’s members to better themselves and grow like trees, it is essential that “different persons should be allowed to lead different lives”; for “in proportion as this latitude has been exercised in any age, has that age been noteworthy to posterity.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc"><sup>9</sup></a>

On this foundation, Mill builds his harm principle. An individual should be free to hold his own opinions and exercise his individuality, so long as it does not cause harm to anyone else. “Neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another … that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it,” says Mill, because “in each person’s own concerns, his individual spontaneity is entitled to free exercise.” Mill admits that individuals will inevitably make mistakes and engage in conduct that society disapproves of, but claims that these “are far outweighed by the evil of allowing others to constrain him to what they deem his good”;<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc"><sup>10</sup></a> for “public opinion means, at the best, some people’s opinion of what is good or bad for other people; while very often it does not even mean that.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a> The extent of Mill’s liberty ends where “there is a definite damage, or a definite risk of damage, either to an individual or to the public,” such as a lapse in critical responsibilities.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc"><sup>12</sup></a>

In short, Mill’s harm principle defines liberty not just as freedom from political tyranny but also the freedom to circulate novel opinions and be a unique individual, thereby improving oneself and society at large. These are noble goals, and the Constitution enables the pursuit of them with its Bill of Rights guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of press, and due process–fair application–of law. But liberty is an _abstract_ idea in the Constitution, taken for granted and never precisely defined. It occurs first in the preamble: “We the People of the United States, in Order to … secure the Blessings of _Liberty_ to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” The Constitution enumerates its other guiding principles and objectives, to “establish justice,” “insure domestic Tranquility,” “provide for the common defence,” and “promote the general Welfare” elsewhere in the preamble, but the meaning of the crucial term liberty is left unexplained and ambiguous. This is also true of the Fifth Amendment within the Bill of Rights: “No person shall … be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Liberty appears again in the Fourteenth Amendment, which recycles text from the Fifth Amendment to require due process of the states: “… nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” These are the only references to liberty in the Constitution, and none of them gives a proper definition.

Nothing in the Constitution contradicts the harm principle, but nothing suggests that the harm principle must be the one true interpretation of liberty. The Constitution does not say that society ought to allow the elevation of human qualities through circulation of opinion and self-expression and that liberty is the right to do whatever does not cause harm to other people. And it does not say that liberty “allow[s] persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,” as the majority opinion claims.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a> In fact, the Constitution frames no conception of liberty within its text. Thus, no rational conception of liberty has a better constitutional claim than any other. Substitute John Stuart Mill’s harm principle. Substitute James Madison’s liberty, a collection of “fundamental rights” including the “freedom of the press,” “Trial by Jury,” the “right of suffrage,” and “the equal right of every citizen to the free exercise of his Religion.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>14</sup></a> Substitute Frederick Douglass’s liberty, the “virtuous freedom” of manhood, education, and self-determination, which he contrasts with the “vicious dissipation” of drunkenness and self-abuse that slave owners “artfully labelled with the name of liberty.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc"><sup>15</sup></a> Or substitute Professor Angela Davis’s liberty, a state which is “not a fact, [is] not a given, but rather something to be fought for” that can “exist only through a process of struggle”; that comes about through an “open act of resistance” that brings about “liberation.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote16sym" name="sdfootnote16anc"><sup>16</sup></a> No alterations of the text or convoluted reinterpretations are necessary; the Constitution accommodates each one.

Liberty in the Constitution is not an idea that is fixed and set in stone. Even the majority opinion acknowledges this: “The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote17sym" name="sdfootnote17anc"><sup>17</sup></a> And as Justice Roberts notes, “Under the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote18sym" name="sdfootnote18anc"><sup>18</sup></a> Since the Constitution does not say what liberty is, it is improper for the Supreme Court to enforce any specific conception of it. Instead, the American people have the right both to determine what liberty means and to change its definition through what Roberts calls “the democratic process”: open public debate and the passage of legislation.

Justice Roberts asks “whether, in our democratic republic, that decision [to change the institution of marriage] should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote19sym" name="sdfootnote19anc"><sup>19</sup></a> The _Obergefell v._ _Hodges_ ruling is indeed a dangerous usurpation of power that rightfully belongs to Congress and the people for the Supreme Court, but its real significance is more profound than the legal definition of marriage. The erroneous enshrinement of the harm principle in the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Constitution means that Americans will not only see their laws judged by the standard of the harm principle, but have also lost the ability to define liberty for themselves. And what kind of liberty is that?
