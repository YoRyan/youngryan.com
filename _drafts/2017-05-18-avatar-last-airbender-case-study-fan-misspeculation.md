In recent years, many rumors have spread throughout the _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ fandom about what went on behind the scenes during the production of the original show. They&#8217;re particularly prevalent on certain Tumblr [blogs][1] and they usually concern main character Katara&#8217;s relationships with Avatar Aang and Prince Zuko. In between my university finals, I&#8217;ve spent the last few days researching these claims. It was tough, since most of the &#8220;sources&#8221; have been lost to the Internet.<!--more-->

The rumors are all a load of nonsense based on either misinformation or gross exaggerations. They often conflict each other, but they boil down to three key ideas:

#### Claim 1: Aang and Katara&#8217;s romantic relationship was not planned until the very end of the series, at which point it was shoehorned in due to executive meddling. {.western}

Fans claim that series creators Bryan and Mike stated there was a &#8220;50/50 chance&#8221; that Katara would have ended up with Aang some time after the broadcast of the series. The [source][2] of this claim is a 2009 Comic Con attendee who allegedly thanked Bryan and Mike &#8220;for the Kataang [Katara-Aang romance]&#8221; and received &#8220;well, it was a 50/50 chance&#8221; in response. If true, they were most likely joking, especially since they knew the guy was into shipping because he mentioned Kataang. This account should be taken with a little skepticism since the fan wasn&#8217;t even sure whether Bryan or Mike said it. Nonetheless, this gets misconstrued as an official statement on the development of the storyline.

The Avatar Extras commentary for Book One is also frequently cited. Specifically, in &#8220;The Avatar Returns,&#8221; [one of][3] the notes states that &#8220;Zuko was originally going to be the love interest for Katara.&#8221; However, the next line reads &#8220;She does like bad boys,&#8221; so this statement is clearly meant to be taken tongue-in-cheek, as is the rest of the humor-laden commentary. Even if the writers considered pairing Katara and Zuko at some point in the show&#8217;s conception, it apparently had no bearing on the final product.

Another source for this claim is an alleged leak of the series bible posted [on 4chan][4]. Fans [claim][5] that the series bible – at least this anonymously posted, paraphrased version – does not mention a relationship between Aang and Katara. That&#8217;s true, but this appears to be an _extremely_ early draft of the show with many changes from the final version; for example, it includes the male version of Toph and the Aang/Katara/Toph love triangle. Furthermore, this same source speaks of a &#8220;Character Relationships&#8221; section that opens with &#8220;The relationship between Aang and Katara is the emotional heart of the show.&#8221; So if this &#8220;leak&#8221; is legitimate, then it&#8217;s evident that Aang and Katara&#8217;s relationship was already receiving special attention from the writers. It&#8217;s possible that the bible or the leaker omitted any further elaboration for any number of reasons.

Finally, there&#8217;s a [roundtable interview][6] that Last Airbender Fans did with filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan, of _The Last Airbender_ infamy. He recalls that when he spoke to Bryan and Mike during the production of Book Three, &#8220;they hadn&#8217;t even decided where things were going to end, even like who Katara was going to end up with.&#8221; I admit that I can&#8217;t explain this one; it seems entirely at odds with the way the show actually played out. [Other fans][7] noticed this, too. Perhaps Shymalan misspoke; as we all know, his film was not exactly faithful to the spirit of the original show.

What is clear from the events of the show is that the romantic relationship between Aang and Katara was foreshadowed heavily, midway through Book One in &#8220;The Fortuneteller&#8221; and certainly by the beginning of Book Two in &#8220;The Cave of Two Lovers.&#8221; Once the Track Team got the Kataang leitmotif going, it became all but inevitable&#8230;

&#8230;and Mae Whitman also cited that scene when she mentioned in an interview that Katara had a &#8220;little crush&#8221; on Aang.

#### Claim 2: The writing staff, particularly Aaron Ehasz, favored a relationship between Katara and Zuko over Katara and Aang. {.western}

Some fans [claim][8] that the writers favored a Katara and Zuko pairing. Direct quotes are never cited, and as far as I can tell, none of the writers have made any such statements. However, they were well aware of the shipping phenomen – head writer Aaron Ehasz himself gave a tongue-in-cheek [presentation][9] on the matter at the 2006 Comic Con – and there seem to be number of ship teases sprinkled throughout the series. [Other][10] [fans][8] claim that Ehasz and Bryan and Mike often butted heads over Katara-centric episodes such as &#8220;The Waterbending Master&#8221; and &#8220;The Southern Raiders.&#8221; Again, there are no sources for these theories other than hearsay or speculation.

Some fans who identify themselves as &#8220;[members][11] of the professional art community&#8221; or &#8220;former Nickelodeon [interns][5]&#8221; with insider knowledge mention that the writing staff were &#8220;surprised&#8221; at Aang and Katara&#8217;s resolution in the series finale. This hardly seems credible; episode production is a collaborative effort, and nothing Bryan or Mike could have done would have surprised the other writers. Ehasz in particular was the series&#8217; head writer, and was once [credited][12] (instead of Bryan and Mike) by CNN for &#8220;crafting the characters millions watched.&#8221; He was also given writing credit for &#8220;The Fortuneteller&#8221; and &#8220;Sozin&#8217;s Comet, Part 2.&#8221; Ehasz was not only responsible for a big moment between Aang and Katara, he also knew exactly how the finale was going to play out.

Another source for this claim is a lecture given by Aaron Ehasz on the writing of _ATLA_ at the University of California, Berkeley – the class [was real][13] and the lecture was [probably real][14]. Ehasz is [alleged][15] to have said that &#8220;If Katara got with Zuko, six year olds would cry.&#8221; Pairing Katara with Aang may have indeed been the most appropriate choice for a children&#8217;s show, but that decision reveals nothing about Ehasz&#8217;s personal preferences. The idea that Ehasz wanted to write a romance between Katara and Zuko, until Bryan, Mike, and Nickelodeon interfered, has no basis in this observation. Once again, I take Ehasz&#8217;s statement as more of a joke than a serious reflection of his opinion on the relationships between the series&#8217; characters.

#### Claim 3: A fourth book was planned at the series&#8217; conception but was canceled when M. Night Shyamalan received the rights to produce an _Avatar_ film trilogy. {.western}

The [same][5] [fans][11] who claim to have insider knowledge of the production of the show often speak of a canceled &#8220;fourth book.&#8221; Supposedly, it was conceived by Aaron Ehasz and would have involved more exploration of the Air Nomads, more character development, resolution of dangling plot threads like Zuko&#8217;s mother, and a romance between Katara and Zuko.

<p align="left">
  A common source for this claim is an alleged <a href="http://kataraandzuko.tumblr.com/post/139513727723/conversation-i-had-with-aaron-ehasz-in">conversation</a> a fan had with Ehasz in Philadelphia, in which he reiterated these plot points and expressed disappointment at the show&#8217;s ending after three seasons. This sounds suspiciously like <i>another</i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080724001846/kataangforever.net/forum/index.php?topic=13596.0">meeting</a> between Ehasz and a fan, also in Philadelphia, that was posted about back in 2008. That one concerned the finale, not what Ehasz thought was left unexplored. It&#8217;s not clear whether either conversation actually happened.
</p>

<p align="left">
  A <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronehasz/status/569254629743005696">tweet</a> sent by Ehasz in 2015 that says, &#8220;Wait, if it&#8217;s been ten years, why haven&#8217;t we finished [the] fourth season yet?&#8221; is also commonly cited. This was probably a joke on Ehasz&#8217;s part that some fans have taken as a reference to an actual, unfinished fourth arc.
</p>

So why wasn&#8217;t this hypothetical fourth season ever produced? Allegedly, it was shelved when M. Night Shyamalan got the green light to produce _The Last Air__b__ender_. A UC Berkeley student who took the &#8220;Metaphysics of Avatar&#8221; class [claims][16] [Ehasz][17] said this during his lecture, but it&#8217;s difficult to assess her credibility without direct quotes. Besides, nothing in her account suggests what the content of the fourth season might have been.

<p align="left">
  All available evidence suggests that the show was always planned for three seasons. Bryan and Mike have stated this in <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Transcript:IGN_interview_with_Bryke,_October_2,_2014">every</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081216091221/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=133106">interview</a>, and if you believe the version of the series bible leaked to 4chan, that draft also had only three books. Furthermore, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/25/business/la-fi-ct-airbender-20100625">according</a> to the LA Times, M. Night didn&#8217;t discover the show until Book One was out on DVD and Book Two was airing. By that time, the writers had almost certainly already made the decision to write a three-season arc.
</p>

If a Book Four was ever conceived, it would have featured a completely new storyline shaped by Bryan and Mike. After the conclusion of the original series, they were interested in expanding the _Avatar_ franchise, but as they [admitted][18] in an interview with IGN, they had &#8220;no interest in ever diving back into&#8221; the original characters. Thus, their new _Avatar_ story did not take the form of an immediate sequel; instead, it became _The Legend of Korra_.

#### Conclusion {.western}

I have little interest in the phenomenon known as &#8220;shipping&#8221; and the endless battles over whether Aang or Zuko was the better match for Katara. Rather, I am interested in in how and why the writers made the decisions they made from the moment they conceived of a show with magical martial arts.

The notion that Aaron Ehasz and the other writers of the original show disliked the romance between Aang and Katara and wanted to revise it in a followup season may appeal to certain segments of the fandom, but it&#8217;s a conspiracy theory supported by wild extrapolations of miscellaneous statements, unverifiable evidence, and speculation. Writing is a collaborative effort. _ATLA_ turned out as well as it did because everyone had a fair say in the development of the cast, story, and setting.

Yet I see fans passing around these claims, in a a game of telephone, as if they were fact; &#8220;some Tumblr user said that Ehasz said&#8221; becomes &#8220;Ehasz said&#8221; becomes &#8220;Ehasz has stated multiple times that.&#8221; I see the loudest [voices][19] promoting these rumors and few rebutting them.

I, for one, don&#8217;t care for revisionist history. Real life is usually not so exciting, and confirmation bias afflicts even the most well-intentioned amateur investigators. We should be skeptical and critical of fan theories gone wild. Or, as we might call them these days, _fake news_.
