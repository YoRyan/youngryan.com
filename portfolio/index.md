title: My Stuff

I'm a regular contributor to open-source projects--but if the software I need doesn't exist, I won't hesitate to build it myself. Perhaps you'll find my code useful, too.

## Train Simulator Classic

I'm a contract developer for [Dovetail Games](https://dovetailgames.com/), the makers of *Train Simulator Classic*, with a focus on US releases. My main job is writing the [TypeScript](https://typescripttolua.github.io/) (or Lua) code that simulates all of the unique subsystems on board the train. I also provide assistance with the physics and sound models when needed.

I got my start on the platform as a modder. I am interested in making improvements to content that was released long ago, while creating open-source implementations that other modders can build off of.
