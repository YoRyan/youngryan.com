I have been meaning to publish this for awhile, but it sat on my back burner.

On March 3, I gave a talk to my fellow Polymathic Scholars on the importance public transportation. It&#8217;s sort of a hybrid presentation that explains both how to use transit and also how it&#8217;s planned.

Check out the slides [here](/archive/utexas/2017-03-03_PolymathicScholars_TransitTalk.pdf).
