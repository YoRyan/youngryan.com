I usually keep my writings on my personal blog and [The Daily Texan](https://www.dailytexanonline.com/author/ryan-young) separate, but I&#8217;ll make an exception here: this post is an addendum to my recent opinion [column](https://www.dailytexanonline.com/2017/05/04/campus-maps-should-show-alternate-transportation) on sustainability and the UT campus map.

Here&#8217;s how I think the campus map _should_ look like. I took the visitor [map](https://parking.utexas.edu/maps/visitor/visitor-map.pdf) from the Parking and Transportation Services website and added the UT shuttle campus circulators and some suggested bicycling routes.

(I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the segregated bike lanes on Guadalupe and Dean Keeton, but they are depicted for posterity&#8217;s sake.)

If we want to claim the mantle of a sustainable campus, a map like this is just plain common sense.
