A shiny new bicycle and pedestrian bridge [opened](https://www.mystatesman.com/news/transportation/bike-bridges-open-linking-south-austin-zilker-park/8u7nEF0jQGaU1XW55DZVyL/) across Barton Creek in June, right next to the MoPac expressway. I finally got a chance to check it out last Sunday morning.

Here&#8217;s a photo tour, starting from the north toward Zilker Park and moving south toward Sunset Valley. You can also check out my corresponding [editorial](https://dailytexanonline.com/2017/07/28/mopac-bike-bridge-stunning-but-plays-hard-to-get-to) on The Daily Texan.

There&#8217;s not even a bike lane on the frontage road. It gets even worse past the bridge, where the shoulder becomes a right-turn lane." captionmarkdown="true" %}

{% include figure.html image="/assets/posts/wp-uploads/2017/07/MoPacBridge_IMG_20170723_124154.jpg" caption="The northbound side doesn&#8217;t fare much better. It&#8217;s a one-way bike lane that also dead-ends." captionmarkdown="true" %}

{% include figure.html image="/assets/posts/wp-uploads/2017/07/MoPacBridge_IMG_20170723_124417.jpg" caption="I opted to wrong-way on the wide shoulder of the northbound side to leave Gaines Ranch and access the rest of South Austin. The only alternative was to mountain bike in the Barton Creek Greenbelt (or take my chances on the southbound frontage road)." captionmarkdown="true" %}

The bridge has some really scenic views &#8212; that you wouldn&#8217;t see flying by at 70 or 25 mph on MoPac &#8212; but there&#8217;s no safe way across the frontage roads. That will be constructed as part of a different trail [project](https://austintexas.gov/ybctrail). For now, you can&#8217;t actually reach the Southwest Parkway, despite media reports.

That makes the new bridge useless to the vast majority of potential cyclists who wouldn&#8217;t put up with that intimidating last mile. As nice as it is to ride (but would it kill them to put in some shade?), it&#8217;s looking a lot like Sarah Palin&#8217;s infamous &#8220;[bridge](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/09/palin.earmarks/index.html) to nowhere.&#8221;
